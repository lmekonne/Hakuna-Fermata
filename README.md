Title: Sunrise to Morning

Description of Song:
My song is titled “Sunrise to Morning” and my song is supposed to be a relaxing and calming song that you should listen to when you wake up. My generated music piece has several melodies playing throughout the song yet there are some surprises in it so it does not sound too repetitive.

Growing up in Eritrea, I had a lot of jazz playing and lofi music playing around. I also listened to a lot of Eritrean nursing rhymes that I wanted to incorporate those aspects into my music so my song can be more novel. In the beginning of the song, I wanted it to be peaceful and relaxing music. However, I know that my music can be calming and possibly too calming for the average student so I asked my mom to assist me with that. I have my mom singing twice at the end of the video singing an Eritrean version of “Brother John” encouraging the listener to wake up and to conquer the day! I wanted to make the video calming with lofi music but also to wake up the student and have a motherly voice within the background to get them less stressed about their finals!

In the beginning of the song, I utilized the concept of lowering the tempo to make sure that the students heart rates are not too high during these stressful times. From the "Chill Music Quickstart" I noticed that our heartbeat gradually slows to match the beat so I wanted to be aware of this fact and incoropated it into my song. I utilized two live loops called slow_down and drums. Slow_down is supposed to be mealody that is supposed to gradually slow down which is important so that the student's hearts rate getting gradually slower so they are more calm. Drums is supposed to keep them slighly awake and to not completely fall asleep. I wanted to have two instruments that were different but complimented each other so the song sounds mellow. 

Further, I created this tick within my song that is supposed to intensifies one note in each chord especially with the "slow_down" mealody. Then I start to incoropate the melodies (melody 1 and melody 2) that will utilized to make the song have the "dreamy" and "fantastical" feel. I utilized chords that had both aspects of Ethiopian jazz and lofi vibes. I adjusted Ethiopian chords that I looked at through sources that talk about Ethiopian music theories. Ethiopia has a modal system called qenet and has four main modes (tezeta, bati, ambassel, and anchihoy). A very popular type of mode within my region (Tigray) is Tizita. I used this mode as inspiration to make my song and to incoropate some Eritrean infleunce to this study song! Towards the end of the song, I wanted to make sure that the students were not falling asleep so I added an element of surprise (bass live loop) and tension to grab the listener but not too much surprise so they don't get off track. At the end, I wanted to ensure that the students were awake and wanted to add my own creative twist to this project so I record a clip of my mom singing a song. This song she would sing to me when I would be falling asleep or just jokingly to wake me up, this song has been used thoroughout my childhood but also makes me realize I need to get up so I wanted to add it into my song!

Description of the Video:
I believe that one of the prettiest and most relaxing things is nature and especially sunrises. I have definitely have drove to the ocean to see the sunrise or accidentally seen sunrises during my all-nighters here at Bowdoin. Nonetheless, there are amazing and it also goes along with the vibes of most Ethiopian jazz songs I listed to growing up that had most of their music videos in the highlands of Ethiopia/Eritrea.
